In France, **associations** are typically structured as non-profit organizations, meaning their primary goal is not to generate profits for individuals but to pursue a collective purpose or public interest. However, it is possible for **founders** or members of an association to receive payment, but certain rules apply:

### 1. **Non-profit Nature of the Association**
   - The primary purpose of an association under French law is **non-profit**. This means any surplus generated should be reinvested into the association's activities and goals, not distributed as profit to members, founders, or others.
   - The law specifically prohibits the distribution of profits to members or founders. So, any financial compensation should not be seen as a **profit distribution**.

### 2. **Founders Receiving Payment**
   Founders **can** receive compensation, but only under certain conditions:
   
   - **Employment Contracts**: If the founder is working for the association, they can be paid a salary, but they must have a valid **employment contract** (CDI, CDD). The work performed must be aligned with the association’s purpose, and the compensation should be reasonable and reflect the actual work done. It's also important that the salary is in line with what would be paid for similar positions in other non-profit organizations.
   
   - **Honorary Fees or Reimbursement**: Founders or members can receive honorariums (for specific tasks or services), or they can be reimbursed for expenses incurred in carrying out the association's activities. However, this must not be seen as a profit but as a reimbursement for actual costs.

### 3. **Limits on Compensation**
   - The amount paid to a founder or member must be **justifiable** and appropriate for the work being done. The compensation cannot be disproportionate to the non-profit goals of the association.
   - If the association is recognized as a public utility ("association reconnue d’utilité publique"), additional restrictions on compensation may apply.

### 4. **Regulatory Transparency**
   - The association must be **transparent** about compensation. Typically, this involves disclosing payments in annual reports or financial statements to ensure the funds are being used properly in line with the non-profit status.
   
   - **Audits**: If the association has significant funding (such as public or private grants), it might be subject to audits to ensure compliance with non-profit regulations.

### 5. **Founders with No Employment Role**
   - If the founders do not take on any official role or employment within the association (e.g., they are not employed or do not provide services for which they can be paid), they cannot receive any compensation from the association. Their role remains as founders, and they can only benefit from the association’s outcomes in an indirect way (such as being involved in governance or decision-making).

### Summary:
Yes, **founders can receive payment** from a French non-profit association, but only under the conditions that they are performing actual work for the association (via an employment contract or honorariums), and the compensation must be reasonable and in accordance with the non-profit nature of the association. Profits cannot be distributed, and any payments must comply with legal and financial transparency requirements.
