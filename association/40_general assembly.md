### **Steps to Hold the General Assembly (AG)**

1. **Call for the General Assembly**:
   - **Notice of Meeting**: A notice should be sent to the founding members (and other members, if applicable) to inform them about the date, time, and location of the General Assembly. The notice should also include the **agenda** of the meeting, which typically includes:
     - Approval of the statutes.
     - Election of the board of directors (if applicable).
     - Discussion of the association's objectives, finances, and future activities.
  
2. **Hold the Meeting**:
   - During the General Assembly, the founders or the appointed organizer (often the president or another key figure) will present the **draft statutes** for approval. This allows members to review and suggest modifications if needed.
   - If the statutes are approved, the assembly will proceed to the **election of the board of directors** (if the association has such a structure).
  
3. **Approval of Statutes**:
   - The statutes must be formally **approved** by the assembly, typically through a **vote**.
   - A simple majority vote is generally required unless the statutes specify otherwise.
  
4. **Election of the Board of Directors** (if applicable):
   - The General Assembly may elect members to the **board of directors** or specific leadership positions, such as:
     - **President**
     - **Secretary**
     - **Treasurer**
   - If applicable, the members of the association will vote to fill these positions according to the rules outlined in the statutes.
   - Voting procedures should be clearly outlined in the statutes and typically include an open vote or a secret ballot.
  

### **Output of the General Assembly**

The formal outcomes (or **output**) of the General Assembly will be:

1. **Approval of Statutes**:
   - The statutes, having been discussed and approved, are now considered **finalized** and are the governing document of the association.
   - The **minutes of the meeting** should record that the statutes were approved by the majority vote of the members present or represented.

   Example:
   - *“The General Assembly held on [date] approved the statutes of the association as presented. The vote was passed with [X] in favor, [Y] against, and [Z] abstentions.”*

2. **Election of the Board of Directors** (if applicable):
   - The individuals who are elected to the board of directors should be recorded in the **minutes**.
   - The names, positions, and any details related to their election should be documented, including the voting results for each candidate.

   Example:
   - *“The General Assembly elected the following members to the board of directors: [Name], President; [Name], Secretary; [Name], Treasurer. The vote for each position was [X] in favor, [Y] against, and [Z] abstentions.”*

3. **Minutes of the General Assembly**:
   - The **minutes** of the meeting should be prepared as a formal document, summarizing the decisions made during the assembly, including:
     - The approval of the statutes.
     - The election of the board.
     - Any other decisions made by the assembly.
   - The minutes should be signed by the president and secretary (or the individuals presiding over the assembly).

   Example of Minutes (Simplified):
   - **Date**: [Date of the General Assembly]
   - **Location**: [Location of the meeting]
   - **Participants**: [Names of attendees or count of attendees]
   - **Agenda Items**:

     3. **Other Decisions**: [Summary of other topics discussed, such as activity plans, budget approval, etc.]
   - **Signed**: [President] [Secretary]

4. **Submission of the Statutes to the Prefecture**:
   - Once the statutes are approved, they must be filed with the **prefecture** (local government office) along with a **declaration** that the association has been formed.
   - This will give the association its **official legal status** and allow it to operate legally in France.

   Example:
   - *“The General Assembly confirmed the approval of the statutes. A copy of the approved statutes, along with the declaration of the creation of the association, will be submitted to the prefecture for registration.”*

### Final Steps After the General Assembly

1. **Registration with the Prefecture**: Submit the signed **statutes** and **minutes** of the General Assembly to the local prefecture to officially register the association. Once registered, the association will receive a **SIREN number** and can begin operating legally.

2. **Open the Association to Membership**: If the association is intended to be open to broader membership, this step allows for recruiting new members and starting the work of the association.
