Creating an association in France is a fairly straightforward process but requires careful attention to legal details. In France, associations are governed by the **1901 Law on Associations**, which allows individuals to form nonprofit organizations. Here's a general outline of the steps you would need to take to create an association in France:

### 1. **Define the Purpose and Activities**
   - **Purpose**: Your association must have a nonprofit purpose (e.g., cultural, humanitarian, educational, sports, etc.).
   - **Activities**: Be clear about what activities your association will engage in. These must align with the purpose defined.

### 2. **Gather the Founders**
   - You need at least **two people** to form an association. These founders can be French or foreign citizens. They will help write the association’s constitution and sign necessary documents.

### 3. **Create the Statutes (Bylaws)**

   The **statutes** (statuts) are the core documents that define the association’s governance structure, purpose, and rules. Here are the key elements usually included in the statutes:
   - Name of the association  (must be unique  = not already be used!)
   - Objective or purpose
   - Address of the association
   - Membership requirements (how to become a member, conditions of membership, etc.)
   - Rules about the management of the association (the board, roles, responsibilities, etc.)
   - How decisions are made and meetings are organized
   - How funds are raised and managed
   - Dissolution clause (what happens if the association is dissolved)

### 4. **Hold a General Assembly**

1. Notice of Meeting with Agenda
2. Hold the Meeting 
	2.1 approve draft statutes via vote
	2.2 elect president and secretary
3. Produce final statutes
4. produce minutes of the meeting 
	4.1 date location participants
	4.1 systematically mention "vote approved at 100% in favor, 0 against, and 0 abstentions"
	4.1 statutes are finalized
	4.1 mention  president is 
	4.1 mention  secretary is 
	4.1 is treasurer needed ?
	4.1 sign the minutes by attendees

	
   Once you’ve created the statutes, the founding members must hold a **General Assembly** to formally approve the statutes and elect the board of directors (if applicable). This step is not legally required, but it is highly recommended to have a clear governance structure in place from the start.

### 5. **Register the Association**

See https://www.service-public.fr/particuliers/vosdroits/R1757
- Procès-verbal de l'assemblée constitutive ou son extrait daté et signé, portant le nom et le prénom du signataire 
- Statuts de l'association datés et signés par au moins 2 personnes mentionnées sur la liste des dirigeants (  nom, prénom, et fonction 

   Once registered, your association will be given a **SIREN number** (business identification number), which allows it to operate legally in France.


### 6. **Open a Bank Account**
   Your association will need a bank account in its name to manage funds and make transactions. To do so, you will need:
   - Proof of registration (SIREN number).
   - A copy of the statutes.
   - The names and positions of the association's officers.

### 7. **Comply with Ongoing Obligations**
   Once your association is created, you will need to ensure ongoing compliance with French laws, which may include:
   - Regular filing of financial statements.
   - Holding General Assemblies (typically once a year).
   - Reporting to the authorities when necessary.
   
If the association has over a certain threshold of funding, it might need to file additional financial reports or undergo auditing.

### Additional Information:

- **Tax Benefits**: If your association qualifies as a non-profit organization, it may be eligible for certain tax exemptions, such as VAT or corporate tax exemptions.
- **Funding**: If your association plans to fundraise or apply for grants, you will need to follow specific rules and regulations related to fundraising in France.
- **Nonprofit Status**: If you plan to apply for public subsidies or are seeking grants, it’s essential that your association operates on a purely nonprofit basis, meaning no members benefit financially from the association's activities.

If you need help with any of these steps, it’s often a good idea to consult with a local lawyer or specialist familiar with French association law to ensure you’re in full compliance with regulations.
